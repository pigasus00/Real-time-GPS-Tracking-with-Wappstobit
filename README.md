# Real-time-GPS-Tracking-with-Wappstobit
The core of this project involved programming the micro:bit to send location data to the Wappsto:bit, which then communicated with our web application. We designed the web interface to provide a user-friendly visualization of the geolocation data, ensuring that the information was accurate and up-to-date.
