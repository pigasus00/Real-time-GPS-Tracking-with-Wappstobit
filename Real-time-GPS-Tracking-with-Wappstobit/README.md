# Real-time-GPS-Tracking-with-Wappstobit
The core of this project involved programming the micro:bit to send location data to the Wappsto:bit, which then communicated with our web application. We designed the web interface to provide a user-friendly visualization of the geolocation data, ensuring that the information was accurate and up-to-date.

We no longer have access to wappsto:bit, but we hope this repository conveys our experience with API management, JSON, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

P.S. This project was a collaboration with Enric Navarro Ferrando (@pigasus00).
